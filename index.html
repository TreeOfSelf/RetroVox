This revision is after me giving up on working with my last version. Things I am going to try and do better this time:
1. Make sure the coordinate space matches the world space
2. Make sure the seaming is implemented correctly
3. Make it single threaded, then go to multithreaded further down the line. 

Notes:

RetroVox refers to Z as the vertical elevation. [X,Y,Z]

So all the above have been implemented. I am now going to implement dynamic colors. I wanted to do textures but looking
online it seems like that would be very complex, and at the seams they would probably look very funky. For now I am
just going to add a new array that defines the type of voxel, then in the mesher it will assign a color based on the type plus
possibly using the position to slightly distort the colors. Wow, almost a month of work.

Over 6 months forward now. It is hilarious reading that I knew from the start texture seaming woudl look funky, and now that 
I have it implemented the seams are indeed harsh.
