Culling:

All blocks created will be checked for culling.
Culling happens when a block is completely surrounded by other blocks. If blocks are deleted, the blocks around
the deleted blocks are re-checked for culling to see if they are uncovered.
When building, the blocks around the built block will  also be checked, to see if they are now covered.
																		
Block Creation: 
block_create(x,y,z,dontCull)

1. Creates the block 
2. Sends the block data to the buildBuffer to be culled, if dontCull is 0, set dontCull to 1 if this block will certaintly 
be culled 
3. Each frame the entire buildBuffer & deleteBuffer are sent to the culling
4. Culling receives information on new blocks and decides which chunks at which layers need to be reculled. 
5. Culling sends chunkData back, chunks are set to be reDrawn and layers are specifically marked.
6. Each frame each chunk drawn is checked if it needs to be drawn, if it does, it goes through each layer and
 re-draws it if needed using chunk_layer_draw

Seaming of the triangle strips happens at 
1. Inside of the chunk_layer_draw (to seam all blocks in a given layer)
2. at draw_chunk to seam the whole chunk together
3. bufferSubdata to seam chunks together
